For this assignment, we have been asked to develop generative work that responds and alters the content according to real time user interactions. I have looked at many different strategies I can use to meet this objective such as using inspiration from designers and how I can gain an understanding of the different concepts of generative art. I will also look at user interactions so that my work will be easy to function and will be expressive in a creative way. I will make my work user friendly as possible by arranging the HTML web page, in a formal and cooperate design.

The user can control the interface by clicking on the canvas to change the colour, which then displays a range of colours of the the RGB. Changing the colours
can create a unique and appealing generative art. Also the user can clear the canvas by clicking the space button.
